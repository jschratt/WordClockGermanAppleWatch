# WordClockGermanAppleWatch
Created a German WordClock App for the Apple Watch 42 MM

Due Apples Restriktions itÂ´s not possible to deacitvate the normal Time on the upper Right,
and this "Watchface" is started as App so you have to change the Properties that this App always
stays when activate the Watch "Einstellungen/Allgemein/Display aktivieren  Beim Armheben letzte App Anzeigen immer"

Have Fun with this Watchface :-)
